                <p class="lead">The University of HK, founded in 1911, is the oldest tertiary institution in Hong
                    Kong. It was granted a shield and a motto by the College of Arms in 1913, and throughout its history
                    the University's visual identity has been firmly based on their display, often coupled the
                    University's name. This is a distinction that resonates outside HK, particularly in the
                    United Kingdom, other Commonwealth jurisdictions, and the United States. It is also a reminder of
                    the University's antiquity, and a most dignified and effective corporate identity.</p>
